At each step of the iteration, an item is taken from the front of things and put
onto the front of answer, causing them to end up in reverse order.

In his second attempt Louis simply uses cons with the arguments reversed. This
creates a left-heavy tree, whereas a list is expected to be a right-heavy tree.
That is to say, each cell has the item's contents as its cdr, and the pointer to
the next item as its car, which is the wrong way round for a list.
