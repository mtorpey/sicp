new-if is a procedure, and under applicative-order evaluation, all arguments to
a procedure are evaluated before the procedure is applied. This means that the
iterative call to sqrt-iter is always evaluated even if the guess satisfies
good-enough, so the recursion does not end. if is a special form which does not
evaluate its arguments unless necessary.
