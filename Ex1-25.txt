Alyssa's proposed algorithm is shorter to wrote and should work. However, the
intermediate values would get extremely large in comparison. Note that

    (fast-expt base exp)

is likely to go through Î˜(log exp) steps, each one handling numbers anywhere up
to base^exp. If the numbers are integers, we get very large numbers which take a
long time to process; and if they're floating point numbers we risk losing
precision. The expmod algorithm from the textbook reduces them modulo m at every
stage, so we never have to deal with numbers much bigger than m.
