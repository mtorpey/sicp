The first process is recursive, since none of the inc calls can be evaluated
until the base case (= a 0) is satisfied. (+ 4 5) expands to

(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))

The second process is iterative, since the + expression is rewritten directly
to another + expression with arguments that can be evaluated immediately. The
expression (+ 4 5) evaluates in the following chain:

(+ 4 5)
(+ 3 6)
(+ 2 7)
(+ 1 8)
(+ 0 9)
9
