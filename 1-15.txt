The evaluation proceeds as follows:

sine 12.15
p sine 4.05
p p sine 1.35
p p p sine 0.45
p p p p sine 0.14
p p p p p sine 0.05
p p p p p 0.05

The procedure p is applied 5 times.

The process develops into a linear chain of calls to p, with the argument to
sine dividing by 3 each time. The argument reaches 0.1 in around log₃(10a) calls
to sine, giving Θ(log n) space and steps.
